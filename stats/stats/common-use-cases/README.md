# Common Use Cases

Even though the **Stats** module is very complete and flexible we also think it might be daunting for those who are not big fans of math or just want to have a basic game with a simple health bar.

We've gathered some common use cases: from simple arcade games to complex RPG systems with different stats affecting the outcome of other stats and attributes.

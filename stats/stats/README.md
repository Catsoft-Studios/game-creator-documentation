# Stats

Almost any game you can play nowadays has some kind of **Stat** system. Whether it is a simple health bar with 100 hit points or a complex RPG with 16 stats that influence the progress of the player and the outcome of any interaction.

The **Stats** module has been designed to be learned in a few minutes, but also allows to handle the most complex cases and keeping everything under control.

## Key Features

* Create a generic **Stats** collection for all characters or objects
* State of the Art **Formula** parser to evaluate complex RPG expressions
* Debug in realtime your data with runtime components that change during play-mode
* Automatically display and update Stats, Attributes and Status Effects on a Canvas
* Easily iterate your system with user-friendly UI
* Intertwine other modules with the **Stats** to extend game mechanics

## Setup

Download the package from the the **Unity Asset Store**. You'll first need to have **Game Creator** installed.

Then, bring up the _Modules Window_ clicking on the Game Creator option in the toolbar. Click the Stats Module **Enable** button.

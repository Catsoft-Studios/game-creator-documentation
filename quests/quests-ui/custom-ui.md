# Custom UI

The **Quests** module comes packed with two assets: the **Journal** and the **Quests HUD**. These assets are nothing more than a combination of default Unity UI components and two Quests components.

## Quest UI Components

Every game has its own unique approach when presenting quests. Some only give you a small text about what to do next, and others may give you a full featured Quest log with history descriptions, detailed tasks and statuses.

That's why we tried to reduce all the complexity to its bare minimum and we came up with just two components:

* Quests Group
* Quest UI

With these two components \(and combining them\) you can create any quest UI.

If you want to create your own **Quest UI** we highly recommend examining and learning how the **Quest Journal** and the **Quests HUD** work by inspecting their component structure.

# Create Quests

Before continuing, make sure you've carefully read the [Quests Overview](quests-and-tasks.md) section and you know the difference between **Quests**, a **Quest Root** and **Tasks**. Once you've done that, open the **Preferences Window** \(âŒ˜ + P\) and click on the **Quests** tab.

![\(Quests dashboard\)](../../.gitbook/assets/quests-preferences.jpg)

On the top-left corner of the **Quests Dashboard** there are three buttons with icons. From left to right:

* Create a **Quest Root**
* Create a **Task**
* Delete selection

{% hint style="info" %}
You can drag and drop the different **Quest** elements and re-order your quests as you want.
{% endhint %}

The right-most icons indicate if that particular **Quest** element has some **Conditions** assigned before they can be **Activated**, whether it has an **On Complete** set of **Actions** and/or an **On Fail** set of **Actions**.

For example, the **Task** `tell-the-king-you-rescued-the-princess` will invoke a set of **Actions** when it successfully completes, and the `give-the-strange-man-the-tiara` will do the same, but also has some **Conditions** before this quest can be **Activated**.

When selecting a **Task** or a **Quest Root** a small _**Edit**_ button will appear next to these icons. This allows you to modify the **Quests** settings, such as the _Title_, _Description_, ...

## Quests Editor Workflow

Creating **Quests** should be quick and efficient when prototyping quest-lines. That's why each quest has a property called **Internal Name**. This property will never be used in your game and is only used for you to easily identify the quest.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Internal Names** should have short and concise nomenclature. They can contain spoilers, as they are only used during development.
{% endhint %}

When creating a new **Quest Root** or a **Task**, the system will assign a randomly generated **Internal Name**. To modify it, simply press _Return_ or _double click_ it to edit it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Internal Names** can only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces are replaced by dashes.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
When prototyping stories, don't waste time setting the _Title_, _Description_ and other quest details. Instead focus on creating a robust quest line structure using the **Internal Name** properties. Once your story makes sense, you can fill the details.
{% endhint %}

## Debugging at Runtime

You can open the Quests Dashboard during runtime and its behavior will change. 

![](../../.gitbook/assets/quests-runtime.jpg)

Each icon will have its own color, depending on the state of the Quest element and its automatically updated.

* **Grey**: Inactive
* **Blue**: Active
* **Green**: Complete
* **Red**: Failed
* **Orange**: Abandoned

{% hint style="info" %}
**Incremental Quests** will also display a green bar with the fulfilled percentage. More information about incremental quests [here](quests-and-tasks.md#incremental-quests).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
It is highly recommended that you have this **Quests Dashboard** open when testing your storylines.
{% endhint %}

# Create Quests

Before continuing, make sure you've carefully read the [Quests Overview](quests-and-tasks.md) section and you know the difference between **Quests**, a **Quest Root** and **Tasks**. Once you've done that, open the **Preferences Window** \(âŒ˜ + P\) and click on the **Quests** tab.

![\(Quests dashboard\)](../../.gitbook/assets/quests-preferences.jpg)

On the top-left corner of the **Quests Dashboard** there are three buttons with icons. From left to right:

* Create a Quest Root
* Create a Task
* Delete selection

{% hint style="info" %}
You can drag and drop the different **Quest** elements and re-order your quests as you want.
{% endhint %}

The right-most icons indicate if that particular Quest element has some Conditions assigned before they can be Activated, whether it has an On Complete set of Actions and/or an On Fail set of Actions.

For example, the Task `tell-the-king-you-rescued-the-princess` will invoke a set of Actions when it successfully completes, and the `give-the-strange-man-the-tiara` will do the same, but also has some conditions before this quest can be activated.

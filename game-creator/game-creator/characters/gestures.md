# Gestures

The **Character** with the **Character Animator** can perform multiple gestures. A **Gesture** is a small movement the character does that doesn't imply changing its state. For example, when two people interact, their hands move according to their verbal language to emphasize their communication.

{% hint style="info" %}
Since version **0.4.1** you can add custom **Gestures** using the new animation system.
{% endhint %}

To add a custom animation, simply use the **Character Gesture Action** and drag an animation to the `gesture` field.

{% hint style="info" %}
Notice that you can also use an **Avatar Mask** to mask the animation from some body parts. For example, you can use an **Upper Body** Avatar Mask to play the previous animation so that the **Character** can use the same animation when walking as while running or being idle.

# Overview

The heart of **Game Creator** is composed of 6 different components. 

The first three \(**Actions**, **Events** and **Triggers**\) focus on giving you the tools to create gameplay mechanics and design interactive elements. The other three \(**Hotspots**, **Characters** and **Camera Motors**\) act as an interface for the previous ones between the player and interactions.

For example, a user controls a **Character** \(Player\) which when it steps on a **Trigger**, it executes a set of **Actions** \(which can be a trap where rocks fall and reduce the player's HP\)

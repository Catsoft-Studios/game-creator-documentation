# Game Creator Toolbar

**Game Creator** is all about speed. Instead of right-clicking on the _Hierarchy Panel_, selecting _Game Creator_ and then picking which component you want to create, you can simply select the component from the **Game Creator Toolbar**.

The toolbar is a small utility bar found at the top-left edge of the Scene view. It's dynamically built. This means that when you install a new modules this may stack a new button at the right.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, the **Dialogue** module adds a button option to create a dialogue component.
{% endhint %}

To reveal the Toolbar click on the Unity's top menu and select `Game Creator → Show Toolbar`. Alternatively you can press `⌘ + T`.

You can dismiss the **toolbar** clicking on the `x` button. You can also drag the toolbar around the _Scene view_ by clicking and holding onto the three horizontal bars.

The rest of the buttons correspond to the main Game Creator components.

{% hint style="success" %}
If you are not familiar with an icon, you can hover the mouse over one and a tooltip will appear with a small explanation of what this button does.
{% endhint %}

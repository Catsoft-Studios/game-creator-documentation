# Custom Save & Load

Game Creator has a built-in functionality for saving and loading games. For non-programmers this should be as easy as use the **Load Game** to load a previously saved game and **Save Game** for saving it.

For programmers, the save/load system has so many constraints that it is nearly impossible to cover all cases with one generic script.

Here we'll cover all the necessary steps you need to take when creating an extension of **Game Creator** or you simply want to use its save/load features with some custom scripts.

{% hint style="info" %}
We've tried to keep the Save/Load manager as simple as possible. If you have a better idea of how to handle this, we're open to discuss the implementation.
{% endhint %}

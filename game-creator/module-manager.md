# Module Manager

## What is the Module Manager

**Game Creator** is a large ecosystem of different parts brought together. Instead of shipping **Game Creator** as a single tool with lots of functionalities, it's split into what is called **Modules**.

A **Module** extends or adds new functionalities to the core tools. Their complexity can range from a simple new **Action** to a complete RPG toolbox with stats, buffs and animations.

{% hint style="info" %}
All modules are available for free at [store.gamecreator.io](https://store.gamecreator.io/)â€‹
{% endhint %}

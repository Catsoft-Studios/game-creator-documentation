# Hotspots

**Hotspots** are interactive elements that provide a simple interface for common gameplay mechanics that are not part of the core of the game.

For example, a typical hotspot is next to a **Trigger** with the option to change the cursor texture when the mouse hovers the object.

{% hint style="info" %}
A **Hotspot** has different options that can be enabled/disabled individually.
{% endhint %}

## Creating a Hotspot

To create a **Hotspot** component simply **Right Click** on the _Hierarchy Panel_ and select `Game Creator → Other → Hotspot`. You can also create a **Hotspot** element adding the component to any Game Object.

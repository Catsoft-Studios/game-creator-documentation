# Actions

**Actions** are one of the core features behind **Game Creator**. They allow to animate characters, activate interruptors, move objects, and a long etcetera.

## Creating an Action

To create an **Action**, right click on the _Hierarchy Panel_ and select `Game Creator â†’ Actions`. Alternatively you can also add the **Actions** component to any **Game Object** or click on the **Actions** button from the [Game Creator Toolbar](../game-creator-toolbar.md).

## Anatomy of an Action

An **Action** is a single instruction that when executed _"does something"_. For example, the action **Wait** puts the execution on hold for a number of seconds.

Here's an example of an action called **Play Sound**.

{% hint style="info" %}
When an **Action** is executed in runtime it will be highlighted in **light blue**. This is very useful when you want to track which instruction is being executed.
{% endhint %}

To add a new Action click on the **Add Action** button. A categorized dropdown window will appear. You can navigate using your _mouse_ or the _keyboard_. 

Select which action you want to add and it will automatically be added at the end of the list.

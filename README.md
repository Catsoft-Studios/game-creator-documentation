**Game Creator** is a set of tools that will help you kickstart your game in matter of minutes. It comes packed with ready-to-use fully animated **characters**, a flexible high-level **scripting language**, a complete save & load system with local and global variables, and much, much more!

On top of all these, **Game Creator** also comes with a state-of-the-art **module manager** that allows to create, distribute and update extension packages. 

For example, the **Inventory** module allows to add a complete Inventory to your game with crafting recipes, usable items and customizable effects. The **Dialogue** module allows to have cinematic conversations between characters with branching options, timed choices, ... You name it!

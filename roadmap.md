# Roadmap

![](.gitbook/assets/roadmap.jpg)

Welcome to the Game Creator roadmap. We hope to keep this page up to date with the latest news about the development direction of our product.

Each year is divided into 3 quarters. Each quarter is a milestone and has a collection of states. In each state we include epics/tasks that must be done. They can either be **Active** or **Delayed**.

At the end of each quarter we'll include a small [postmortem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmortem_documentation) where we'll share insights of what went right and what went wrong during the development cycle. This will be very useful for both us and you.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Game Creator** is a community driven product. Our primary goal is to provide you with stable and reliable releases. As such, any indications of target release dates and features listed are subject to change.

### What went right

* We released Game Creator within the expected deadline. 
* We also were able to effectively communicate what Game Creator is. 
* We released the Inventory module within the expected deadline.

### What went wrong

* We had to redo the Actions & Conditions too many times. The initial approach of nesting Scriptable Objects didn't work as expected. 
* The Module Manager 1.0 architecture did not fulfill the expectations.
* The Variable system was too constrained.
* We couldn't release the Dialogue module within the expected deadline.

# Roadmap

![](.gitbook/assets/roadmap.jpg)

Welcome to the Game Creator roadmap. We hope to keep this page up to date with the latest news about the development direction of our product.

Each year is divided into 3 quarters. Each quarter is a milestone and has a collection of states. In each state we include epics/tasks that must be done. They can either be **Active** or **Delayed**.

At the end of each quarter we'll include a small [postmortem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmortem_documentation) where we'll share insights of what went right and what went wrong during the development cycle. This will be very useful for both us and you.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Game Creator** is a community driven product. Our primary goal is to provide you with stable and reliable releases. As such, any indications of target release dates and features listed are subject to change.

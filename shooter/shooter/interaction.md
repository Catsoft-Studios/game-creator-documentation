# Interaction

The two previous chapters we overviewed how to create a **Weapon** and an **Ammo** object, as well as see what each option does. In this chapter we'll see how to put everything together and make **Characters** make use of the **Weapon** and **Ammo** objects in order to pull, aim and shoot at stuff.

## Character Shooter

The **Character Shooter** component is a special component that must be added to each **Character** that is going to hold a weapon. 

{% hint style="info" %}
If this component is not detected, **Game Creator** will automatically add it for your, but it's better if you add it yourself in the editor, or you'll miss some features, such as saving the amount of ammunition.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
The **Player** should use another component called **Player Shooter** instead. This will allow it to use different aiming modes, unavailable to NPCs.
{% endhint %}

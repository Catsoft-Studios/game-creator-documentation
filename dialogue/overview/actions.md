The **Dialogue** module is 100% customizable and isn't restricted by any type of UI style. You can head to the [Game Creator Store](https://store.gamecreator.io/) and download any **Dialogue Skin** module and start using it right away.

## Using a Skin {#using-a-skin}

A **skin** is a prefab that is used whenever a conversation line or choice is displayed. They are automatically managed by the **Dialogue** module.

To test a **skin** all there is to do is to drag and drop the _Skin Prefab_ onto the **Dialogue Skin** field found in the preferences menu.

Additionally, each **Text Element** has its own unique **Skin** field in case you want to change the skin for a particular conversation line. Otherwise, the default skin will be used.

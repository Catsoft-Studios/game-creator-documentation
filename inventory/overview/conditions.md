# Conditions

The **Inventory** module includes a set of **Conditions** that complement **Game Creator**'s and allow to _check_ whether an **Item** can be bought, if the player has a certain amount of items, etc...

## Condition Can Buy

Checks whether an **Item** or an amount of **Items** can be bought with the current amount of currency.

## Preferences {#preferences}

Before jumping into the _game view_ you'll have to first define at least one **item**. **Items**, **Recipes** and everything related to the **Inventory** is located at the **Game Creator**'s preferences menu. To open it, simply click on the toolbar's _Game Creator_ button and select _Preferences_.

## Game Creator

### What kind of games can I make with Game Creator?

Game Creator is not tied to any specific game genre. You can even create a mobile app that isn't a game with Game Creator. Despite this, we focus all efforts on adventure and action games. Click [here](https://catsoftstudios.itch.io/the-investigation) to see an example of a game made with an early version of Game Creator.

### Where can I learn more about using Game Creator?

You are in the right place! Start by reading the [Get Started](quickstart/get-started.md) section or watch your [Quickstart video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG8GXAAih2Q&list=PL7FyK0gfdpCbxMrWIV9B2xQiExkiZbpa5). Will take you less than 15 minutes.

### Is Game Creator a Visual Scripting tool?

Game Creator is more than a scripting tool. It's an entire game creator toolbox that handles all the heavy lifting and lets you focus on what matters: Making awesome games. It helps you kickstart the development of your games with just a few seconds. Creating cinematic sequences is extremely easy with our [Camera Motors](game-creator/components/camera/). Our [high-level scripting language](game-creator/components/actions.md) abstracts you from complex math and lets you use simple instructions such as: Move character from A to B. Under the hood, these instructions handle collision avoidance, locomotion, acceleration, inverse kinematics to align the feet to the floor, etc... Check the [Get Started](quickstart/get-started.md) section for a complete list of features.

### Can I make a multiplayer game with Game Creator?

Not at the moment. But we've recently partnered with [Ninjutsu Games](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/3171) and they will be developing a module that will allow Game Creator to be used for multiplayer online games.

### Can I use my own scripts with Game Creator?

Yes. Game Creator is all wrapped and isolated in its own namespace. Game Creator has an [open API](game-creator/game-creator-api/) architecture that allows you to extend all functionalities. All logic and data are located inside the [special](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SpecialFolders.html) Plugins/GameCreator/ folder. This means that recompiling your project won't also recompile Game Creator.

### Can I integrate other Unity Asset Store packages with Game Creator?

Absolutely. We actually encourage you to do it! Take for example the Call Method Action. It allows you to call any function from any component \(even custom ones\) with up to one parameter. To make everything even more automatic, we're working on integration modules with the most popular Asset Store packages.

### Where can I find Modules for Game Creator to download?

All available modules can be downloaded from the [Game Creator Store](https://store.gamecreator.io). Some of them are also available in the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/).

### Can I make a feature request?

Sure! Game Creator is a community driven product. This means we're always listening, planning and executing according to what we discussed in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nzN8z5e). Join us! We're really friendly folk ;-\)

### When will Game Creator move beyond Beta phase?

Soon. Well, as soon as we have a stable version :-P We're at the last phase we call \#RoadToStable

### How easy is it to create my own Actions for Game Creator?

If you have at least some programming experience, it's piece of cake. With Game Creator you can create script templates which contain a basic structure from which to code an Action. Check [Custom Actions](game-creator/game-creator-api/custom-actions.md) and [Custom Conditions](game-creator/game-creator-api/custom-conditions.md) for more information.

### Does Game Creator come with its own character controller?

Yes, with jump, run, walk functionalities, smooth locomotion animations, a custom blazing fast Inverse Kinematics algorithm and procedural head tracking. All this with just one click!

### Can I use my own 3D models with Game Creator?

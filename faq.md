# FAQ

## Game Creator

### What's the difference between Game Creator and other Visual Scripting tools \(Bolt, Playmaker, ...\)

Game Creator is more than a scripting tool. It's an entire game creator toolbox that handles all the heavy lifting and lets you focus on what matters: Making awesome games. It helps you kickstart the development of your games with just a few seconds. Creating cinematic sequences is extremely easy with our [Camera Motors](game-creator/components/camera/). Our [high-level scripting language](game-creator/components/actions.md) abstracts you from complex math and lets you use simple instructions such as: Move character from A to B. Under the hood, these instructions handle collision avoidance, locomotion, acceleration, inverse kinematics to align the feet to the floor, etc...

### What kind of games can I make with Game Creator?

Game Creator is not tied to any specific game genre. You can even create a mobile app that isn't a game with Game Creator. Despite this, we focus all efforts on adventure and action games.

### Can I make a multiplayer game with Game Creator?

Not at the moment. But we've recently partnered with [Ninjutsu Games](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/3171) and they will be developing a module that will allow Game Creator to be used for multiplayer online games.

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacations right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.

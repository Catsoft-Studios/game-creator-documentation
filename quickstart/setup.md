# Setup

![](../.gitbook/assets/import%20%281%29.jpg)

Setting up **Game Creator** is really easy.

1. Download the latest `gamecreator.unitypackage`
2. Open your Unity project or create a new one
3. Import the package in **Unity**

{% hint style="info" %}
If you downloaded the **Game Creator** from the **Asset Store** you can skip the first two steps.
{% endhint %}

Once you have **Game Creator** imported in your project you can start developing your game. 

If this is the first time you're using it, we recommend you check out the **Example Scenes**. To open them, simply open the **Module Manager** \[âŒ˜ + M\] and click the **Enable** button in the option _Game Creator Examples_.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The directory **Plugins/GameCreator** and **Plugins/GameCreatorData** and its content must always be at the root of the project and should never be moved.
{% endhint %}
